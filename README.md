# Machine-Monitoring
An Open Source Software to monitor three machines in Pop-up Factory: 
1. Laser Cutter: [OLSK-Small-Laser](https://github.com/Open-Lab-Starter-Kit/OLSK-Small-Laser)
3. CNC Router: [OLSK-Small-CNC](https://github.com/Open-Lab-Starter-Kit/OLSK-Small-CNC)
4. 3D Printer: [OLSK-Small-3D-Printer](https://github.com/Open-Lab-Starter-Kit/OLSK-Small-3D-Printer)

Machine Monitoring provides: 
1. States of machines: eg. Idle, Pause, Run or Job Done,
2. Power consumation of machine in Watt,
3. File name of the laoded gcode,
4. Start Time: when the job is started,
5. End Time: when the job is done,
6. The sumarize table of the jobs done by the machine.

The three machines data are saved into two csv files:
1. The state of the machines and the time when is occured.
2. The details of the Job ID, path of the gcode, start time and end time.
